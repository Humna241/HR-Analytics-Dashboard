**Project Overview: HR Analytics Dashboard for Improving Employee Performance and Retention**

The objective of this project is to help an organization to improve employee performance and employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating this Power BI Dashboard.
By analyzing crucial data points related to employee demographics, educational background, and departmental distribution, the dashboard aims to provide actionable insights 
to inform strategic decisions for talent management.

**Key Insights:**

**Attrition by Education:** A significant 38% of attrition comes from Life Sciences employees, followed by those from Medical and Marketing fields. 
Reducing turnover in these areas may require clearer career pathways, better expectation alignment, and tailored growth opportunities to meet sector-specific needs.  

**Age-Based Attrition:** Age is also a significant factor, as employees between 26–35 years show the highest attrition, followed by those between 18–25 years. After 36 years of age,
Attrition has reduced considerably, suggesting that younger employees are more likely to leave compared to their older counterparts.

**Attrition by Job-Role:** Attrition patterns by job role reveal that Laboratory Technicians (62), Sales Executives (57), and Research Scientists (47) are the most affected groups,
followed by Sales Representatives (33). On the other hand, leadership roles such as Managers and Directors show very low attrition rates, 
indicating that turnover is concentrated in mid- to lower-level positions, particularly in technical and sales-related functions.


**Departmental Attrition:** Among the total of 237 employees leaving, a substantial portion (133) belongs to the Research and Development department. This emphasizes the 
necessity of focusing on R&D-specific strategies to retain valuable talent. It might involve fostering an innovative culture, recognition of contributions, 
and providing avenues for skill enhancement.


**Conclusion:** 
The data highlights several key insights. Younger employees, especially those earning lower salaries, are driving most of the attrition.
Technical and sales roles appear to be the most vulnerable to turnover, while employees with Life Sciences and Medical educational backgrounds 
are more likely to leave compared to others. Although males leave more than females, the difference is not extreme.

These insights point to several areas of focus for the organization. Strengthening onboarding and retention programs within the first two years 
could help reduce early exits. Reviewing compensation structures, particularly for employees earning less than 5K, may improve retention. 
Providing clear career growth opportunities and engagement initiatives for employees in technical and sales roles, as well as targeting younger employees under 35,
could further enhance workforce stability.
